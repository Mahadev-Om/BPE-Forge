# BPE-Forge
Built a custom BPE tokenizer using Hugging Faceâ€™s Tokenizers on WikiText-103. Designed for transformer models with subword segmentation, vocab tuning, and special token support. Enabled JSON export and validation. Highlights my NLP infrastructure skills in optimizing tokenization for speed, accuracy, and seamless integration.
